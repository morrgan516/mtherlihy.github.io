My name is Morrgan Herlihy, and I am a dual-title PhD. Candidate in Political Science and Social Data Analytics at Penn State University.  My primary research interests are in American political institutions, focusing largely on legislatures and courts. Broadly, I investigate how institutional reform, partisan dynamics, and legislative process affect elite decision-making and public attitudes toward judges. My dissertation focuses on the federal judicial confirmation process, analyzing how the nuclear option has transformed the lower court confirmation process into an assembly line for partisan gain.  I use computational methods, including text analysis, natural language processsing, and machine learning, in combination with statistical modeling to advance this line of research.

My work has been funded by a National Science Foundation Law and Sciences Dissertation Grant and the McCourtney Institute for Democracy's [Research in Democracy Support Grant](https://democracy.psu.edu/research-grant-recipients/). My work has also been published in *Political Research Quarterly*.

Outside of work, I am an avid sports fan, animal lover, and a hiker who enjoys hitting the trails wherever I travel. My husband and I share two cats, Lux and Theodore, and a boxer named Ava Marie. Having grown up in New England, I'm a loyal Patriots, Sox, and Celtics fan but I never miss a Penn State football game (We Are!).  Iâ€™m also a tennis fanatic, with a trip to Roland Garros high on my bucket list.
