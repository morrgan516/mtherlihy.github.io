My name is Morrgan Herlihy, and I am a dual-title PhD. Candidate in Political Science and Social Data Analytics at Penn State University.  My primary research interests are in American political institutions, focusing largely on legislatures and courts. My current work examines the federal judicial confirmation process, analyzing both how venue influences senators' question asking behavior toward judicial nominees and how nominees' identity-specifically, race, gender, and partisanship-affects how they respond to senators. More broadly, I use computational methods, including text analysis, natural language processsing, and machine learning, in combination with statistical modeling to investigate how institutional rules, partisan dynamics, and procedural reforms affect elite decision-making.

My work has been funded by a National Science Foundation Law and Sciences Dissertation Grant and the McCourtney Institute for Democracy's [Research in Democracy Support Grant](https://democracy.psu.edu/research-grant-recipients/). My work has also been published in *Political Research Quarterly*. You can find my Department profile [here](https://polisci.la.psu.edu/people/mth5492/) and read more about me [here](https://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/about-us/news-and-features/alumna-named-inaugural-eleanor-roosevelt-memorial-fellow).

Outside of work, I am an avid sports fan, animal lover, and a hiker who enjoys hitting the trails wherever I travel. Having grown up in New England, I'm a loyal Patriots, Sox, and Celtics fan but I never miss a Penn State football game (We Are!).  Iâ€™m also a tennis fanatic, with a trip to Roland Garros high on my bucket list.
