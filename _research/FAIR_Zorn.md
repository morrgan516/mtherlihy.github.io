**Abstract**: Nearly seventy years after Dahl’s landmark (1957) paper, recent events have brought into
sharp focus the propensity of justices on the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold actions taken by
the ruling executive. That propensity is the central subject of our paper. We examine the votes
of the justices in cases where the U.S., broadly construed, is a party, focusing on the extent to
which justices are more likely to support (that is, rule in favor of) the executive branch as a
function of partisan agreement between the justices and that regime. We uncover wide varia-
tion in the justices’ general tendency to support executive claims, and significant variation in
the extent to which that tendency varies across same-party vs. opposite-party executives. Con-
sistent with other recent work in this vein, those variations also exhibit substantial systematic
changes over time.
