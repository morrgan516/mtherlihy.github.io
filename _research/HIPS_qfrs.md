**Abstract**: Senatorial scrutiny of federal judicial nominees has long centered on confirmation hearings as the focal point of the advice-and-consent process. Yet senators draw on multiple sources of information when evaluating nominees for lifetime appointments to the federal bench. Questions for the Record—written questions submitted after hearings conclude—are a common but understudied component of the Judiciary Committee’s vetting process. In this article, I analyze QFR usage for all Court of Appeals nominees from 2001 to 2022. I find that partisan dynamics strongly shape who submits them, while nominee controversy—though significant—plays a more modest role than prior research on confirmation hearings would predict. Moreover, QFR submissions have increased dramatically in recent Congresses, particularly in the post-nuclear Senate. These findings suggest that QFRs are not simply extensions of hearings, but serve distinct strategic functions—especially for partisans and in contexts where time constraints limit other forms of scrutiny.
